\title{Convert FLStock to FLSR}
\usage{
\S4method{as.FLSR}{FLStock}(object, rec.age = dims(stock.n(object))$min, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{FLStock} object to be converted}

\item{rec.age}{Integer specifying the age at which recruitment is measured.
Defaults to the minimum age class in the stock. Must be at least the minimum
age class of the FLStock.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the \code{FLSR} constructor,
including \code{model} to specify the stock-recruitment model formula.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{FLSR} containing:
\item{rec}{Recruitment time series as FLQuant, lagged by rec.age years}
\item{ssb}{Spawning stock biomass time series as FLQuant}
\item{model}{Stock-recruitment model formula}
\item{fitted}{Empty FLQuant for fitted values}
\item{residuals}{Empty FLQuant for residuals}
\item{name}{Name inherited from the FLStock object}
\item{desc}{Description indicating origin from FLStock}
}
\description{
Create a stock-recruitment relationship object (FLSR) from an FLStock object.
The method extracts recruitment and spawning stock biomass (SSB) data from
an FLStock and constructs an FLSR object with properly lagged time series.
}
\details{
The recruitment age (rec.age) is used to align the recruitment and SSB time
series. Recruitment at age \code{rec.age} in year t is paired with SSB from year t-1.
This ensures the stock-recruitment relationship reflects the biological process
where recruitment depends on the parent stock biomass from the previous spawning season.

The time series are aligned as follows:
\itemize{
\item Recruitment data: uses age rec.age from years (1 + rec.age) to end
\item SSB data: uses years 1 to (total years - rec.age)
}

This ensures that recruitment observations are paired with the corresponding
parent stock biomass from the appropriate lag years.

An error is raised if:
\itemize{
\item \code{rec.age} is less than the minimum age class
\item The FLStock recruitment time series is too short (less than rec.age + 1 years)
}
}
\examples{
data(ple4)
# Create FLSR object with default recruitment age
sr <- as.FLSR(ple4, model=bevholt)

# Create FLSR object with recruitment age 2
sr2 <- as.FLSR(ple4, rec.age=2)

# Create FLSR with a specific model formula
sr_bh <- as.FLSR(ple4, model=rec~a*ssb/(b+ssb))
