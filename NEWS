 FLCore 2.6.6

 NEW FEATURES

- window(FLStocks) method to apply same window call across all elements.
- combine(FLStocks) method collapses all elements into a single FLStock object.
  with as many iters as elements in the list, must all have 1 iter.
- combine(FLQuants, FLQuants) merges them one element at a time.
- drop(FLQuant) returns the result of a call to base::drop on @.Data.
- New verify() method for complex classes evaluates object against a set of
  rules. Checks content rather than structure, as validity functions do.
- New ruleset method to return standard verify rules per class.
- window() and expand() methods for FLPar.

 USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- propagate(FLPar) to return object if iter == iters #45.
- Ratios of numbers written in alternative ways now also return an empty character.

 BUG FIXES

- dimnames<- for FLStock with no ages failed when changing age name #42.
- uom can now handle better products with units containing divisions.
- coerce(FLBiol, FLBiolcpp) will now extend srparam to have as many years as the
  object, to allow params per time period to be passed and used.
- coerce(FLBiol, FLBiolcpp) now windows FLPar if year is given.
- trim(FLBiol) is able to handle predictModel slots.
- [[<- and $<- FLlst now work on extended classes, like predictModel.
- predict(predictModel) now handles correctly iters and extra FLPar dimensions.

 DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT
- catchSel is to be substituted by catch.sel, use the later instead
- wt<-(FLStock) is to be deprecated, use the individual accessor methods instead

 FLCore 2.6.5

 NEW FEATURES

- New harvest method for stock.n, catch.n and m, by minimizing diff in catch.
- survey and cpue methods to generate observations from an operating model
- knit_print.FLQuant method for the printr package, better printing of FLQuant
  objects in knitr documents

 USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- FLStock creator uses empty object for sizing, keeps iters but drops them if
  object(s) are named.

 BUG FIXES

- Add tiny value to landings and discards to ensure no division by zero in
  computeCatch.
- Added reduced version to print(FLPar, reduced=TRUE) to reuse in summary methods
 
 FLCore 2.6.4

 NEW FEATURES
- `%=%` operator to modify on thed fly the content of an FLQuant/FLArray. Object
  structure can be reused with contents being changed, e.g.
  FLQuant(2, dim=c(3,10)) %=% 0 will return the object with zeros.

  years and seasons

- A set of aliases for the class creators is now available. Should be used only when working interactively.
- Added dim method to FLQuant and FLStock, ensures an unnamed vector is returned
- Added $ method for FLQuant, operates along 'quant' dimension
- New method metrics to compute from list or function
- Added vb method for vulnerable biomass

 USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- transform(FLComp) now accepts a named FLQuants object as substitution argument (...)

- FLPar validity now checks that content is numeric. Default frist dimname is now 'params'
- FLIndices class can take both FLIndex and FLIndexBiomass objects
- mean.lifespan renamed as meanLifespan to avoid S3 conflict
- uom() returns kg for 1 * kg
- expand() now stops if new dimnames do not contain old ones and these were of length greater than 1
- seasonSums is now based on colSums and aperm, 75 times faster
- new lattice-based plot(FLStocks)
