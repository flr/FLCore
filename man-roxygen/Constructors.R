#' @section Constructor:
#' A construction method exists for this class that can take named arguments for
#' any of its slots. All slots are then created to match the requirements of the
#' class validity. If an unnamed \code{FLQuant} object is provided, this is used
#' for sizing but not stored in any slot.
